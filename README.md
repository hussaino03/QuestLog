- Difficulty and importance ratings: Assign ratings to tasks to determine XP rewards
- Progress tracking: Visual representation of current level and XP progress
- Streak tracking: Tracks the current and longest streak

- Persistent storage: Tasks and progress are saved in MongoDB and synced across devices
- User identification: Unique session IDs for user tracking without login
